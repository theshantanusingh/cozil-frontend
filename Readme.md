# Cozil - Random Video & Text Chat Platform

![Cozil Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150x50?text=Cozil) <!--  I will Replace with my logo later .-->

**Cozil** is an Omegle-style platform where users can connect randomly for text and video chats. This is my super-duper learning project to understand the full stack development process from frontend hurdles to backend complexities.

## üöÄ Project Vision

I'm building Cozil to:
- Experience the raw challenges of pure HTML/CSS/JS in large projects
- Understand security implications in real-time communication apps
- Learn how to scale from monolith to distributed systems
- Prepare for advanced architectures by first walking through basic implementations

## üîß Current Tech Stack (Phase 1)

### Frontend
- **Pure HTML5** - For semantic structure
- **CSS3/Tailwind** - For styling (with glassmorphism effects)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - To feel the pain points before switching to frameworks
- **WebRTC** - For real-time video/audio communication

### Backend (Planned)
- **Node.js/Express** - Initial backend for understanding fundamentals
- **Socket.IO** - For real-time event handling
- **JWT** - For authentication

## üåü Future Architecture (Phase 2+)

When I've conquered the initial challenges, I'll evolve Cozil to:

### Frontend
- **React/Remix or Next.js** - For more maintainable UI
- **TypeScript** - For type safety

### Backend
- **Microservices Architecture**:
  - **NestJS** - For structured Node.js services
  - **FastAPI** - For Python-based services
- **Multi-Database**:
  - **PostgreSQL** - For relational data
  - **MongoDB** - For flexible document storage
  - **Redis** - For caching and real-time features

## üõ† Development Approach

1. **AI-Assisted Coding**: Used AI tools to generate initial code structures(i am writing code for 4 yearsüòÅ, so i know all concepts)
2. **Manual Debugging**: Personally debugged and refactored all code
3. **Security-First**:
   - Implementing end-to-end encryption
   - Building robust moderation tools
   - Following OWASP guidelines
4. **Progressive Enhancement**:
   - Starting simple to understand core concepts
   - Gradually adding complexity

## üß† Learning Objectives

Through this project, I aim to master:

### Frontend
- DOM manipulation at scale
- State management without frameworks
- Real-time UI updates
- Cross-browser compatibility issues

### Backend
- Session management
- Rate limiting
- Database optimization
- API design patterns

### DevOps
- Containerization (Docker)
- CI/CD pipelines
- Load testing
- Distributed system monitoring


## üõ° Security Measures

1. **Content Moderation**:
   - Real-time message filtering
   - User reporting system
2. **Privacy Protection**:
   - No persistent message storage
   - IP address anonymization
3. **Authentication**:
   - Optional guest accounts
   - Email verification for registered users

## üöß Challenges Faced

1. **Pure JS State Management** - CHALLENGES
2. **WebRTC Configuration** - Handling NAT traversal and ICE candidates
3. **Performance Optimization** - Managing memory leaks in long-running chats
4. **Cross-Browser Testing** - Especially for WebRTC features

## üìö Resources Used

- WebRTC Documentation
- Tailwind CSS Docs
- OWASP Security Guidelines
- Various AI coding assistants (for initial scaffolding)

## ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps

1. Implement basic text chat functionality
2. Add user matching algorithm
3. Develop moderation tools
4. Create admin dashboard
5. Plan microservice decomposition

## ü§ù Contributing

While this is primarily a learning project, I'm open to:
- Security suggestions
- Architecture advice
- Performance tips

(Note: Not currently accepting code contributions as this is my personal learning journey)
